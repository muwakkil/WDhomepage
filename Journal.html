    Handmade web-
    The term "handmade web" refers to web pages manually coded by individuals rather than corporations, prevalent in the mid-to-late 1990s. These pages were personal, and experimental, and challenged conventional norms of design, privacy, and identity. Nostalgic for this era, contemporary projects and communities like TILDE.CLUB and UbuWeb revisit these early web aesthetics, valuing the DIY ethic and individuality. The handmade web highlights the manual labor involved in creating web content, contrasting with today's corporate-dominated, automated internet. Advocating for this approach promotes small-scale, creative, and resistant web practices against the increasingly commercialized digital landscape.

        What is a website-

A website is a digital entity composed of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files stored on a server, a computer always connected to the internet. When someone enters a URL, it directs their browser to retrieve these files from the server, displaying the website. Despite the abundance of methods to create websites today, at its core, a website remains a bundle of files accessible via an internet-connected server, often requiring a paid domain name and hosting service. Websites serve diverse purposes, from clear communication to artistic expression, and play a vital role in shaping the webâ€™s future by maintaining individual nodes within the interconnected network.

Chimero advocates for empathy in the design process, aiming to create meaningful and memorable interactions. He underscores the need for balance and harmony, using practical examples to illustrate how constraints can drive creativity and lead to innovative solutions. Reflecting and iterating on designs are crucial
